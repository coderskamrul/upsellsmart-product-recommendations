Local, data-driven UpSellSmart – Product Recommendations with multiple engines and comprehensive admin controls.

== Description ==

UpSellSmart – Product Recommendations provides intelligent product suggestions based on your store's data. The plugin analyzes customer behavior and purchase patterns to recommend relevant products, helping increase sales and improve customer experience.

**Key Features:**

* **Two Recommendation Engines**: Content-based (categories/tags) and Association-based (frequently bought together)
* **Local Data Processing**: All recommendations are generated using your store's data - no external APIs required

* **AJAX Updates**: Cart and checkout recommendations update dynamically without page reload
* **Comprehensive Admin Interface**: Easy-to-use settings panel with detailed configuration options
* **Manual Overrides**: Set custom recommendations or exclude specific products per product
* **Performance Optimized**: Uses caching and background processing to ensure fast page loads

**Recommendation Engines:**

1. **Content-Based Engine**: Recommends products that share categories, tags, or attributes with the current product or cart items. Perfect for showing related products within the same category.

✅ Show/hide price, ratings, and add-to-cart buttons

✅ Exclude specific products from recommendations
✅ Tools for rebuilding and managing recommendation data

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require external services? =

No, all recommendation processing happens locally on your server using only your WooCommerce data. No external APIs or cloud services are used.

= How long does it take to build recommendation data? =

Initial data building depends on your store size. For most stores, it completes within a few minutes. The process runs in the background and won't affect your site performance.

= Can I customize which products are recommended? =

Yes, you can set custom recommendations for individual products or exclude specific products from being recommended. The plugin also provides various filtering and sorting options.

= Will this slow down my website? =

No, the plugin is designed for performance. Recommendations are pre-calculated and cached, so displaying them doesn't require heavy processing during page loads.
